================================================================================

üìÖ RUN INFORMATION:
   Date: 2025-10-11 15:26:45
   Device: mps
   PyTorch: 2.8.0
   Transformers: 4.55.4

üéØ OBJECTIVE:
   Fine-tune DistilGPT-2 to answer medical questions and demonstrate
   understanding of the training process.

üìã MODEL & DATA CHOICES:

   Model: DistilGPT-2 (82M parameters)
   Why? - Decoder architecture for text generation
        - Efficient for training on M3 Pro
        - Pre-trained on general text

   Dataset: MedQuAD (Medical Q&A from NIH/CDC)
   Size: 700 training / 150 validation / 150 test
   Why? - High-quality medical information
        - Q&A format perfect for instruction tuning
        - Diverse medical topics

‚öôÔ∏è HYPERPARAMETERS (Run #1):

   Learning Rate: 5e-05

   ROUGE-L: 0.1543
   ‚Üí Measures similarity to reference answers

   MMLU Benchmark: Check mmlu_results/results.json
   ‚Üí Standardized medical knowledge test

üìà KEY INSIGHTS:

1. Training Progress:
   ‚úÖ Loss decreased consistently across epochs
   ‚úÖ Validation loss tracked training loss (no overfitting)
   ‚úÖ Model converged successfully

2. Performance Metrics:
   ‚Ä¢ Perplexity of 8.00 indicates good language modeling
   ‚Ä¢ ROUGE-1 of 0.1988 shows baseline similarity to references

3. What I Learned About Training:
   ‚Ä¢ Proper data splitting prevents leakage (train/val/test)
   ‚Ä¢ Monitoring validation loss prevents overfitting
   ‚Ä¢ Hyperparameters significantly impact training
   ‚Ä¢ Loss curves visualize the learning process
   ‚Ä¢ Multiple metrics give fuller picture of performance

4. Model Limitations:
   ‚ö†Ô∏è Should not replace professional medical advice
   ‚ö†Ô∏è May occasionally generate incorrect information
   ‚ö†Ô∏è Limited by training data diversity (700 examples)
   ‚ö†Ô∏è Context length restricted to 256 tokens

5. Future Improvements:
   ‚Ä¢ Increase dataset size
   ‚Ä¢ Train for more epochs
   ‚Ä¢ Lower learning rate
   ‚Ä¢ Reduce temperature
