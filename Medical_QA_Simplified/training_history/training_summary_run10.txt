================================================================================

üìÖ RUN INFORMATION:
   Date: 2025-10-15 20:17:55
   Device: mps
   PyTorch: 2.8.0
   Transformers: 4.55.4

üéØ OBJECTIVE:
   Fine-tune DistilGPT-2 to answer medical questions and demonstrate
   understanding of the training process.

üìã MODEL & DATA CHOICES:

   Model: DistilGPT-2 (82M parameters)
   Why? - Decoder architecture for text generation
        - Efficient for training on M3 Pro
        - Pre-trained on general text

   Dataset: MedQuAD (Medical Q&A from NIH/CDC)
   Size: 7000 training / 1500 validation / 1500 test
   Why? - High-quality medical information
        - Q&A format perfect for instruction tuning
        - Diverse medical topics

‚öôÔ∏è HYPERPARAMETERS (Run #10):

   Learning Rate: 7e-05
   Batch Size: 20 (effective: 80 with accumulation)
   Epochs: 12
   Max Length: 256 tokens
   Weight Decay: 0.01
   Warmup Ratio: 0.1
   Generation Temperature: 0.3

üìä TRAINING RESULTS:

   Training Time: 86.96 minutes
   Final Training Loss: 1.8207
   Samples/Second: 16.10

   ‚úÖ Loss decreased over training ‚Üí Model learned!

üéØ EVALUATION METRICS:

   Test Loss: 1.7069
   Perplexity: 5.51
   ‚Üí Lower perplexity = better predictions

   ROUGE-1: 0.3005
   ROUGE-2: 0.1324
   ROUGE-L: 0.2166
   ‚Üí Measures similarity to reference answers

üìà KEY INSIGHTS:

1. Training Progress:
   ‚úÖ Loss decreased consistently across epochs
   ‚úÖ Model converged successfully

2. Performance Metrics:
   ‚Ä¢ Perplexity of 5.51 indicates good language modeling
   ‚Ä¢ ROUGE-1 of 0.3005 shows baseline similarity to references

3. What I Learned About Training:
   ‚Ä¢ Proper data splitting prevents leakage (train/val/test)
   ‚Ä¢ Monitoring validation loss prevents overfitting
   ‚Ä¢ Hyperparameters significantly impact training
   ‚Ä¢ Loss curves visualize the learning process
   ‚Ä¢ Multiple metrics give fuller picture of performance

4. Model Limitations:
   ‚ö†Ô∏è Should not replace professional medical advice
   ‚ö†Ô∏è May occasionally generate incorrect information
   ‚ö†Ô∏è Limited by training data diversity (7000 examples)
   ‚ö†Ô∏è Context length restricted to 256 tokens
