           MEDICAL Q&A FINE-TUNING - RUN #8 SUMMARY
================================================================================

📅 RUN INFORMATION:
   Date: 2025-10-15 15:45:43
   Device: mps
   PyTorch: 2.8.0
   Transformers: 4.55.4

🎯 OBJECTIVE:
   Fine-tune DistilGPT-2 to answer medical questions and demonstrate
   understanding of the training process.

📋 MODEL & DATA CHOICES:

   Model: DistilGPT-2 (82M parameters)
   Why? - Decoder architecture for text generation
        - Efficient for training on M3 Pro
        - Pre-trained on general text

   Dataset: MedQuAD (Medical Q&A from NIH/CDC)
   Size: 7000 training / 1500 validation / 1500 test
   Why? - High-quality medical information
        - Q&A format perfect for instruction tuning
        - Diverse medical topics

⚙️ HYPERPARAMETERS (Run #8):

   Learning Rate: 6e-05
   Batch Size: 20 (effective: 80 with accumulation)
   Epochs: 10
   Max Length: 256 tokens
   Weight Decay: 0.01
   Warmup Ratio: 0.1
   Generation Temperature: 0.6

📊 TRAINING RESULTS:

   Training Time: 119.98 minutes
   Final Training Loss: 1.9054
   Samples/Second: 9.72

   ✅ Loss decreased over training → Model learned!

🎯 EVALUATION METRICS:

   Test Loss: 1.7586
   Perplexity: 5.80
   → Lower perplexity = better predictions

   ROUGE-1: 0.2934
   ROUGE-2: 0.1307
   ROUGE-L: 0.2097
   → Measures similarity to reference answers

📈 KEY INSIGHTS:

1. Training Progress:
   ✅ Loss decreased consistently across epochs
   ✅ Model converged successfully

2. Performance Metrics:
   • Perplexity of 5.80 indicates good language modeling
   • ROUGE-1 of 0.2934 shows baseline similarity to references

3. What I Learned About Training:
   • Proper data splitting prevents leakage (train/val/test)
   • Monitoring validation loss prevents overfitting
   • Hyperparameters significantly impact training
   • Loss curves visualize the learning process
   • Multiple metrics give fuller picture of performance

4. Model Limitations:
   ⚠️ Should not replace professional medical advice
   ⚠️ May occasionally generate incorrect information
   ⚠️ Limited by training data diversity (7000 examples)
   ⚠️ Context length restricted to 256 tokens
